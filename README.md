I once a had an interview assessment requiring me to programme a game of life in C# using tdd. Since I didnt get the job, its safe to say that I floop the assessment. Now lets go for it again but this time with whole new set of requirements.

## Requirements

1. Web Application
2. Input live cells by mouse down event
3. Upload patterns by file upload
4. Have different surfaces, for example sphere, cuve, pyramid 
5. Run inside or on the surface of a shape

It would be cool if we had in a AR application visualizing the game of life on walls or float on tables

6. migrate to a mobile AR application
